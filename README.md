# Resume-Web-Generator

# How to Start
The framework uses nanohttpd for communication between the backend and frontend. You can launch the backend server by navigating to the “/backend” directory and running “mvn clean install” to install the dependencies, then running “mvn exec:exec” in the terminal to launch the backend server.
The frontend web-based GUI can be launched by navigating to the “/visualization” directory and running the “npm install” and “npm start” commands in the terminal.

# How to Use
After starting the application, an initial web page will allow the user to specify their local file path (full path required) and the type of file they would like to input (PDF, JSON). If the file is not found or the file has an illegal format, the GUI will warn the user of the error and allow them to try again. After successfully loading the resume file, the GUI will prompt the user to optionally upload a profile photo and write a short description. Then, the web page will display the given information and graphs/diagrams generated by the visualization plugins. The web page can be traversed by using a navigation bar at the top of the page.
